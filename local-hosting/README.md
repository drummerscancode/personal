# Local hosting from Mac

* Create an account in DynDns (or easydns etc)
* Open a port on your router
* Test with dummy_server.py
* Follow http://carl.hoyer.ca/2012/05/02/updating-root-dns-dynamically-using-ddclient-on-osx.html with the conf file provided.
Note: Launchpd does not work from tmux.
* Enjoy


## Security Considerations
* Open a non-standard port on your router
canyouseeme.org
* Whitelist certain IPs only.
Very static: access from phone?
* MAC filters work only for local network.

External hosting more secure?
